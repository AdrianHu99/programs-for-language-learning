        What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
        To you your father should be as a god;
        One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
        To whom you are but as a form in wax
        By him imprinted and within his power
        To leave the figure or disfigure it.
        Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

        I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
        I know not by what power I am made bold,
        Nor how it may concern my modesty,
        In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
        But I beseech your grace that I may know
        The worst that may befall me in this case,
        If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

        My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
